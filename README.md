# yk-encrypt.py

A not good demo of Yubico's ykcs11 library for RSA decryption with
Yubikey-backed private keys.

# usage

0. Reconsider!

1. Plug Yubikey in.

2. Install dependencies with `pipenv install`

3. Run script to check for round-trip encrypt/decrypt success with `pipenv run python yk-encrypt.py`
